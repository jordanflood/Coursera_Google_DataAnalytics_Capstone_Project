Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share
In this project, I analyzed data using Excel, SQL, and Tableau for a fictional company named Cyclistic. Through my analysis, I developed a visualization of the commonalities and differences of how casual and member riders used different kinds of bikes and created plans of action to assist the marketing team in converting more casual riders into members.

Background
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share offering with over 5,824 bicycles in the Chicago area. They have over 600 stations in the area and have built a client base by marketing to broad consumer segments and offering a variety of bike styles to accommodate all riders. Casual riders in the system purchase either single or full day passes while members hold annual passes. The finance analysts have discovered that annual members are more profitable than casual riders and wish to increase the number of members.
